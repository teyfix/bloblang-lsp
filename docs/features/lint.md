# Lint rules and fixes

The AST linter supports the seven slash-separated IDs in the [generated rule reference](lint-rules.md). All keys remain flat under `lint.rules`, which gives JSON completion the full rule names while retaining a visible namespace hierarchy.

```json
{
  "lint": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "correctness/environment/require-fallback": "warn",
      "style/assignments/prefer-grouped": {
        "severity": "hint",
        "minAssignments": 4
      },
      "style/objects/prefer-with": "off"
    }
  }
}
```

The environment rule distinguishes unset values from errors: `env()` returns null when unset, so `.catch(...)` alone is insufficient. Recognized handling includes `.or(default)`, `.or(throw(...))`, `.not_null().catch(...)`, a coalesce fallback when the lookup is the left operand, and supported explicit null checks on a local binding.

Assignment grouping, object projection/deletion, and array existence rules are advisory. Rewrites need care: `assign()` merges nested objects, `with()` omits missing fields, and `any()` changes predicate evaluation through short-circuiting. The implementation limits grouping findings based on output state and expression structure. Unused local bindings are warnings and are not automatically removed because evaluation may perform work or throw.

`style/objects/combine-without` offers an explicit `quickfix` for consecutive `without()` calls with literal arguments and no comments. Embedded YAML fixes are offered for plain and literal mappings; quoted and folded mappings retain their diagnostics without this edit. Other rules currently offer diagnostics only. The server does not implement a `source.fixAll` action or apply lint refactors during formatting.

Suppress a rule for the next source line with its exact ID. Multiple IDs can be separated by commas or spaces; `all` suppresses all rules for that line. A reason after ` -- ` is optional.

```bloblang
# bloblang-lint-disable-next-line correctness/environment/require-fallback -- optional value
root.optional = env("OPTIONAL")
```

Registry descriptions, default severities, options, and safe-fix capability live in [`internal/editorconfig/config.go`](../../internal/editorconfig/config.go); diagnostics and code actions live in [`internal/lsp/lint.go`](../../internal/lsp/lint.go). See [settings](../core/settings.md) for schema generation and invalid-configuration behavior.
